Pokémon Gold Spaceworld 1997 Demo Minigame recreation in Unity 2018.

Instead of being the same notes all the time, this minigame uses audio spectrum to generate the heights for the notes (This doesn't work on WebGL so on WebGL version heights are random).

It may contain bugs. It's gonna be improved by the time.  It is open-source.


Controls:​
- Click / Press Enter to confirm and jump. 
- Numpad 1,2,3 changes the difficulty.
- Escape to go back to menu from the game.
